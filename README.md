### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Marcelo, I was born in Brazil and live in Berlin. I believe that my educational background as an economist with focus on causal inference, coupled with my interests in programming as well as being a long time Linux user and tinkerer put me in the right track to learn and grow in the data science field. 

If you got here from my job application, please have a look around the pinned and following repositories.
