### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Marcelo, I was born in Brazil and live in Berlin. I believe that my educational background as an economist with focus on causal inference, coupled with my interests in programming as well as being a long time Linux user and tinkerer put me in the right track to learn and grow in the data science field.
